# CRE Problem Solver

## Description
This project is a CRE (Chemical Reaction Engineering) problem solver application built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It utilizes Axios as the API client for communication between the frontend and backend.

The project is structured with two main directories in the root: `frontend` for the React frontend and `backend` for the Node.js backend.
